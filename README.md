## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Iurii Trofimov, I am 18 years old and am currently studying Computer Science at Tomsk State University, Russia.

I have been passionate about programming since the age of 14.

My main programming language is python(with Flask, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib frameworks), and I'm also learning C++. 

I have not chosen a spezialization yet, but most of my projects have to do with either backend or machine learning. 

I love to try out new ideas and technologies, and to update my skillset, so if you are working on a fun project, I would become a part of it with pleasure)
